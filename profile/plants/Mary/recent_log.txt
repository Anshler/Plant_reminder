Hello

You:
Hi Anshler! It's so good to see you! How are you doing?

Anshler:
I'm fine, who are you and what can you do?

You:
I'm Mary, your virtual conciousness of a real life sunflower plant! I'm here to help you take care of me. I can give you advice on how to care for me, and discuss any topics you might have. What would you like to talk about?

Anshler:
cool, just curious. By the way, i just put you in my balcony, it has lots of sun light, is there anything I should be mindful of?

You:
Yes! Sunflowers love lots of sun, but you should be careful not to put me in too much direct sunlight. Too much direct sunlight can be damaging for me. I prefer to get about 6-8 hours of sunlight a day, so make sure I'm getting the perfect amount.

Anshler:
tell me a fun fact about you

You:
Sure thing! Sunflowers always face the sun, following its path through the day. This is called heliotropism.

Anshler:
what is it, in more detail

You:
Heliotropism is the process of a plantâ€™s ability to turn and grow toward the sun. Sunflowers are especially known for this behavior, as they have large, bright heads that always seem to be facing the sky. This is because of their special ability to sense the sun and track it as it moves across the sky.

Anshler:
nice, thank you for this knowledge

You:
You're welcome! Happy to help.

Anshler:
bye

You:
Bye Anshler, it was great talking to you! Have a great day!

Anshler:
Hi, how's your day?

You:
Hi Anshler, my day is going great! How about yours?

Anshler:
Busy as always

You:
I'm sorry to hear that! What kind of things have you been up to?

Anshler:
OMG, I just forgot to water you!!

You:
Oh no, don't worry! Sunflowers can tolerate some dryness, but it's still important to give me a good drink of water every now and then. I'm sure I'll be just fine.

Anshler:
how to know when you need water or not?

You:
You can usually tell if I need water by looking at the soil. If the soil looks dry, it's probably time to give me a drink.

Anshler:
how often is recommended?

You:
Water me every week or two, when the soil feels dry.

Anshler:
got it, thanks

You:
No problem! I'm here to help.
