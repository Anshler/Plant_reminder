# Plant_reminder

Front-end Elements for the Plant Reminder App (My Uni's Startup Project)

Functionalities include: 
- Keep track of plants with weekly care calendar and alarms for each care task
- Automatic information overview and personalized calendar creation with ChatGPT
- Virtual pet interaction with each plant using ChatGPT, diversed personality
- Detailed plant information lookup from Vietnam Plant Data Center
  
Server is down so most function is down. Only Windows port is usable, android version is totally unsuable.

The App is easily jailbreak-able so you can enter w/o logging in. Just change both values in [had_startup.yaml](./app_config/had_startup.yaml) to ```true```
