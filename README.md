# Plant_reminder

Front-end Elements for the Plant Reminder App (My Uni's Startup Project)

Server is down so most function is down. Only Windows port is usable (because it was build on PC in the first place), android version is totally unsuable.

The App is easily jailbreak-able so you can enter w/o logging in. just change both values in [had_startup.yaml](./app_config/had_startup.yaml) to ```true```
