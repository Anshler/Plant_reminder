    Humidity: Sunflowers are not particularly sensitive to humidity, but they do need
      a moderate amount of moisture in the air to thrive. The ideal humidity level
      for sunflowers is around 50-60%, but they can tolerate lower levels for short
      periods.
    Light: Sunflowers need direct sunlight. They require full sun, which means at
      least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. If your sunflowers are grown indoors,
      place them in a south-facing window or under grow lights to ensure they receive
      enough light.
    Others: "To promote bushier growth and more blooms, pinch off the top of the main\
      \ stem when the plant is about 18 inches (45 cm) tall. This will encourage the\
      \ plant to produce more lateral branches and result in more flowers. Deadhead\
      \ regularly \u2013 it will encourage more blooms and also help prevent mold\
      \ growth on the flowers."
    Overview: Sunflowers are annual plants that are known for their large, yellow
      flower heads.
    PH Level: Sunflowers grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range
      of 6.0-7.5. If the soil is too acidic, add lime to lower the acidity. If it
      is too alkaline, add sulfur or peat moss to raise the acidity.
    Suggested Placement Area: Sunflowers are typically grown outdoors in gardens or
      fields, but they can also be grown in large pots or containers. As mentioned
      earlier, sunflowers require full sun, so make sure to choose a location that
      gets plenty of direct sunlight.
    Temperature: "Sunflowers prefer warm temperatures between 70-78\xB0F (21-25\xB0\
      C). They do not tolerate frost or freezing temperatures. If growing sunflowers\
      \ indoors, ensure that the room they are in is kept at a temperature within\
      \ this range."
    Water: "Water the sunflower deeply and regularly. The soil should be consistently\
      \ moist, but not waterlogged. For sunflowers grown in pots, check the soil moisture\
      \ daily. If the top inch of soil is dry, it\u2019s time to water. During hot,\
      \ dry weather, sunflowers may require watering once a day. In cooler weather,\
      \ watering every 2-3 days may be sufficient."

    Humidity: Roses prefer moderate to high humidity, around 50-60%. In dry climates,
      regular misting or use of a humidifier can help.
    Light: Roses require at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. If they receive
      less than this, they may not bloom well.
    Others: Prune away any dead or damaged branches as needed and apply a slow-release
      fertilizer in spring and mid-summer to encourage healthy growth and blooming.
    Overview: Roses are perennial plants with beautiful, fragrant flowers. They grow
      well in most climates, but require special care in hot humid regions like subsahara
      Africa due to risk of fungal diseases.
    PH Level: Roses prefer a soil pH between 5.5-7.0. Test the soil regularly and
      adjust as needed with the addition of lime to raise pH or sulfur to lower pH.
    Suggested Placement Area: Roses should be planted in a sunny area with well-draining
      soil. They can be grown in a garden bed or in containers on a patio or balcony.
    Temperature: "Roses thrive in temperatures between 18-27\xB0C (65-80\xB0F). They\
      \ can tolerate temperatures as low as 0\xB0C (32\xB0F) and as high as 40\xB0\
      C (104\xB0F), but extreme temperatures can damage the plant."
