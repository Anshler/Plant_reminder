    Humidity: The Swiss Cheese Plant thrives in high humidity. You can increase humidity
      around the plant by using a humidifier, placing a water tray near the plant,
      or by misting the leaves with water. In Vietnam's climate, you may not need
      to use extra methods of humidification as it is already fairly humid.
    Light: The Swiss cheese plant prefers bright, indirect sunlight, but can tolerate
      some shade. Avoid direct sunlight as it can burn the leaves.
    Others: It's important to periodically clean the leaves with a damp cloth to remove
      any accumulated dust. Fertilize the plant about once per month during the growing
      season with a balanced fertilizer to encourage healthy growth.

      indoor plant that can grow up to 10 feet tall. It has large, glossy, heart-shaped
      leaves that develop splits and holes as they mature.
    PH Level: The ideal PH for the Swiss cheese plant is within the range of 6.0-7.5
    Suggested Placement Area: The Swiss Cheese Plant can be placed in many areas of
      the home, but it requires sufficient space due to its size. Place it in a bright
      corner away from direct sunlight and away from cold drafts or air conditioning
      units.
    Temperature: "The ideal temperature range for the Swiss Cheese Plant is between\
      \ 65-85\xB0F (18-29\xB0C). Avoid placing the plant in areas with cold drafts\
      \ or near air conditioning units that may cause temperature fluctuations."
    Water: Water the Swiss Cheese Plant regularly, but allow the soil to dry out slightly
      between waterings to avoid overwatering. In Vietnam's climate, you may need
      to water it more frequently due to the humidity. Aim to keep the soil consistently
      moist during the growing season (spring-summer) and reduce watering during the
      dormant season (fall-winter).

    Humidity: Ferns require relatively high humidity levels, ideally between 40-60%.
      If the air in your home is particularly dry, consider using a humidifier or
      placing a tray of water near your plant to increase moisture levels. Misting
      your fern regularly can also help to boost humidity levels.
    Light: Ferns prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch their delicate
      leaves, so be sure to place your fern in a location that receives plenty of
      filtered light throughout the day.
    Others: Fertilize your fern once a month during the growing season (spring and
      summer) with a balanced houseplant fertilizer. Trim off any dead or damaged
      fronds as needed to promote new growth and maintain the plant's appearance.
    Overview: Ferns are leafy, green plants with delicate, frilly fronds. They require
      relatively high humidity levels and moderate temperatures to thrive.
    PH Level: Ferns prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 to 7.0.
    Suggested Placement Area: Ferns are versatile and can thrive in a variety of locations,
      including bathrooms, bedrooms or living rooms. Consider placing them near a
      window with filtered light and ensuring their surrounding environment has enough
      moisture and humidity.
    Temperature: "Ferns prefer moderate temperatures between 60-75\xB0F (15-24\xB0\
      C). Avoid exposing your fern to sudden temperature changes, such as drafts or\
      \ air conditioning."
    Water: Water your fern regularly, ensuring that the soil never dries out completely.
      Be careful not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot. In general, watering
      once a week should be sufficient, but depending on the humidity level in your
      home and the size of your plant, you may need to water more or less often.
