    Humidity: This plant enjoys moderate to high humidity levels. You can increase
      humidity by placing a tray of water near the plant or using a humidifier if
      you live in a dry area.
    Light: The fiddle-leaf fig thrives in bright, filtered light. Place it near a
      window that receives morning or afternoon sunlight but avoid direct sunlight,
      which can scorch its leaves.
    Others: Fertilize your fiddle-leaf fig every 4-6 weeks during the growing season
      (spring and summer) with a balanced fertilizer. Prune the plant to maintain
      its shape and remove any dead or yellowing leaves. If you notice pest or disease
      issues, treat them promptly with an organic or chemical solution.

    Humidity: The Swiss Cheese Plant thrives in high humidity. You can increase humidity
      around the plant by using a humidifier, placing a water tray near the plant,
      or by misting the leaves with water. In Vietnam's climate, you may not need
      to use extra methods of humidification as it is already fairly humid.
    Light: The Swiss cheese plant prefers bright, indirect sunlight, but can tolerate
      some shade. Avoid direct sunlight as it can burn the leaves.
    Others: It's important to periodically clean the leaves with a damp cloth to remove
      any accumulated dust. Fertilize the plant about once per month during the growing
      season with a balanced fertilizer to encourage healthy growth.

      indoor plant that can grow up to 10 feet tall. It has large, glossy, heart-shaped
      leaves that develop splits and holes as they mature.
    PH Level: The ideal PH for the Swiss cheese plant is within the range of 6.0-7.5
    Suggested Placement Area: The Swiss Cheese Plant can be placed in many areas of
      the home, but it requires sufficient space due to its size. Place it in a bright
      corner away from direct sunlight and away from cold drafts or air conditioning
      units.
    Temperature: "The ideal temperature range for the Swiss Cheese Plant is between\
      \ 65-85\xB0F (18-29\xB0C). Avoid placing the plant in areas with cold drafts\
      \ or near air conditioning units that may cause temperature fluctuations."
    Water: Water the Swiss Cheese Plant regularly, but allow the soil to dry out slightly
      between waterings to avoid overwatering. In Vietnam's climate, you may need
      to water it more frequently due to the humidity. Aim to keep the soil consistently
      moist during the growing season (spring-summer) and reduce watering during the
      dormant season (fall-winter).

    Humidity: Fiddle leaf figs are tolerant of lower humidity levels than some other
      tropical plants, but they still prefer a moderately humid environment. It is
      recommended to place a humidifier nearby, especially during the dry season.
    Light: Fiddle leaf figs prefer bright, indirect light but can adapt to medium
      light. They do not do well in low light or direct sunlight which can cause their
      leaves to burn.
    Others: Fiddle Leaf Fig leaves are sensitive to touch and can become damaged easily.
      It is important to prune the plant regularly to maintain its shape. Yellowing
      or dropped leaves can indicate under or over watering, insect infestation, or
      disease. If you have any concerns, it is recommended to consult with a local
      plant care specialist.
    Overview: Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) is a tropical plant native to western
      Africa. It is a popular houseplant with large, violin-shaped leaves that can
      grow up to 18 inches long and thrive in warm environments.
    PH Level: Fiddle leaf figs prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil. The optimal
      pH range is between 6.0-7.0.
    Suggested Placement Area: Place Fiddle Leaf Fig in a large container in a well-draining
      potting mix and position it in a spot that gets bright, indirect light or partial
      shade. It is recommended to turn the plant every few months so that all leaves
      receive equal sunlight.
    Temperature: "Fiddle leaf figs prefer a temperature range between 60-85 degrees\
      \ Fahrenheit (15-29 degrees Celsius). They can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures\
      \ but should not be exposed to cold drafts or temperatures below 50\xB0F (10\xB0\
      C)."
    Water: Water the Fiddle Leaf Fig thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry.
      Avoid watering too much or too little. It is best to let the soil dry out slightly
      between watering. Water less in winter months and more in the summer

    Humidity: Cactus used to dry environments and hence does not need high humidity.
    Light: Cactus prefers bright and direct sunlight. At least 6 hours a day.
    Others: During the summer months, it is advisable to move the cactus outdoors
      in a sunny location. Cactus is susceptible to root rot and hence it is critical
      to ensure the pot has adequate drainage holes and soil is well-draining. Avoid
      over-fertilizing the cactus.
    Overview: Cactus is a low maintenance plant that can adapt to harsh conditions.
    PH Level: Cactus prefers slightly acidic soil, with PH levels of 5.5-7.
    Suggested Placement Area: Ideal placement would be on a windowsill facing the
      sun. Ensure the windowsill has adequate drainage for excess water and possible
      condensation.
    Temperature: Cactus thrives well in average room temperatures, from 20-27 degrees
      Celsius. During winter, temperatures should not drop below 10 degrees Celsius.
    Water: Watering once a month is enough. Do not over-water the cactus. Ensure the
      soil completely dries out before watering. During winter when the cactus is
      dormant, water even less often, about once every 6 to 8 weeks.

    Others: Roses benefit from regular fertilization and pruning to promote healthy
      growth and flowering. Look out for common pests such as aphids and spider mites.
    Overview: Roses are perennial flowering plants native to Asia and are popular
      for their showy, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors.
    PH Level: Roses prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0-6.5.
    Suggested Placement Area: Roses do well in outdoor gardens or in large pots. They
      need plenty of space to grow and airflow around the plant to avoid diseases.
    Temperature: "Roses tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but prefer cooler temperatures\
      \ between 60-75\xB0F."
    Water: Roses require deep watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between
      watering. During hot and dry periods, increase watering frequency to avoid the
      soil drying out completely. Avoid wetting the leaves as it can cause diseases.

    Humidity: Ferns require relatively high humidity levels, ideally between 40-60%.
      If the air in your home is particularly dry, consider using a humidifier or
      placing a tray of water near your plant to increase moisture levels. Misting
      your fern regularly can also help to boost humidity levels.
    Light: Ferns prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch their delicate
      leaves, so be sure to place your fern in a location that receives plenty of
      filtered light throughout the day.
    Others: Fertilize your fern once a month during the growing season (spring and
      summer) with a balanced houseplant fertilizer. Trim off any dead or damaged
      fronds as needed to promote new growth and maintain the plant's appearance.
    Overview: Ferns are leafy, green plants with delicate, frilly fronds. They require
      relatively high humidity levels and moderate temperatures to thrive.
    PH Level: Ferns prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 to 7.0.
    Suggested Placement Area: Ferns are versatile and can thrive in a variety of locations,
      including bathrooms, bedrooms or living rooms. Consider placing them near a
      window with filtered light and ensuring their surrounding environment has enough
      moisture and humidity.
    Temperature: "Ferns prefer moderate temperatures between 60-75\xB0F (15-24\xB0\
      C). Avoid exposing your fern to sudden temperature changes, such as drafts or\
      \ air conditioning."
    Water: Water your fern regularly, ensuring that the soil never dries out completely.
      Be careful not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot. In general, watering
      once a week should be sufficient, but depending on the humidity level in your
      home and the size of your plant, you may need to water more or less often.
