    Humidity: Red roses prefer a moderate to high humidity level. Mist the leaves
      regularly, especially during dry seasons.
    Light: Red roses prefer full sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. Place the plant
      near a south or west-facing window.
    Others: Prune your rose regularly to remove dead or diseased parts and promote

      become heavy with flowers. Use a balanced fertilizer every two weeks during
