    Humidity: "Cacti are tolerant of low humidity and can easily cope with the average\
      \ humidity of Vietnam. You don\u2019t need to worry about humidity levels as\
      \ cactus is desert plants and naturally adapted to dry air."
    Light: "Cacti thrive in bright, direct sunlight, which is abundant in the tropics.\
      \ Place the cactus near to a window that gets plenty of sunshine or under grow\
      \ lights if it doesn\u2019t receive enough sunlight."
    Others: Be cautious when handling cactus, as they are covered with sharp spines
      that can cause injury. You may want to use a thick glove when handling them.
      Fertilize the cactus once in a month during its active growth phase, which is
      usually from spring to fall.
    PH Level: Cactus prefers slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soil with a pH range
      between 5.5-7.5. You can use cactus soil from a nursery, or mix sand and peat
      moss from your garden to get the right pH.
    Suggested Placement Area: "Place the cactus in a location with good air circulation\
      \ and keep it away from drafts. Avoid placing it in areas where the temperature\
      \ can drop below 10\xB0C."
    Temperature: "Cactus typically prefers warm and hot temperatures, ranging from\
      \ 20-30\xB0C. These are common temperature ranges in Vietnam, so your cactus\
      \ should grow well in its natural environment."
    Water: Cactus should be watered once in every 2-3 weeks. Water the cactus slowly
      and deeply ensuring the soil is evenly moistened. Do not water when the soil
      is wet or partially wet and avoid waterlogging as it can lead to root rot.

    Humidity: 'Fiddle leaf figs are native to tropical rainforests, which means they
      like high humidity. For Southern Africa''s relatively dry climate, spraying
      the leaves with a spray bottle as well as placing a bowl of water next to the
      plant can help create a more humid environment around the plant. '
    Light: Fiddle leaf figs need bright, filtered light. They like bright but indirect
      sunlight and are happiest near a north-facing window. In South Africa, it is
      highly recommended to place the plant in an area that gets strong morning light
      but avoids afternoon sun. Too much direct sunlight can scorch their leaves.
    Others: Fiddle-leaf figs can be a bit sensitive to changes in their environment,
      so try not to move them around too much once you find their happy place. Check
      the plant regularly for signs of pest infestation or other issues such as brown
      spots on leaves or yellow leaves. If any issues are detected, take corrective
      action such as treating the pests or adjusting watering or light levels.
    PH Level: "Fiddle-leaf fig plants prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between\
      \ 6.0 and 7.0. The plant appreciates a balanced liquid fertilizer once every\
      \ month. It\u2019s important to understand that any sudden drop or increase\
      \ in pH, resulting from poor soil quality or over-fertilization, can negatively\
      \ affect the health of the plant."
    Suggested Placement Area: 'As mentioned before, the ideal location for a fiddle-leaf
      fig is a well-lit place with bright, indirect sunlight, so it is recommended
      to place it near a north-facing window away from drafts. They do well in larger
      rooms since they can grow up to 6 feet tall indoors. Direct contact with concrete,
      cold floors, or window panes can lead to root rot. '
    Temperature: "Fiddle leaf figs grow best in temperatures between 60 and 75 degrees\
      \ Fahrenheit (15 \u2013 24\xB0C). Keep the plant away from drafts from windows,\
      \ doors, or air conditioning units which might make the temperature too extreme\
      \ for it to thrive. In South Africa the temperature averages between 10\xB0\
      C and 30 \xB0C so it should do well indoors."
    Water: Water your Fiddle-leaf fig deeply, when the top 1-2 inches of soil become
      dry. This generally takes around 7 - 10 days depending on the temperature and
      humidity of the room. Make sure the pot has plenty of drainage holes, and make
      sure it's not sitting in standing water. Like most indoor plants, they don't
      like to sit in water for too long. For the location in South Africa, adjust
      watering frequency based on temperature and humidity.

    Humidity: Red roses prefer a moderate to high humidity level. Mist the leaves
      regularly, especially during dry seasons.
    Light: Red roses prefer full sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. Place the plant
      near a south or west-facing window.
    Others: Prune your rose regularly to remove dead or diseased parts and promote
      healthy growth. Provide support for the plant as it grows, as the branches can
      become heavy with flowers. Use a balanced fertilizer every two weeks during
      the growing season.
    PH Level: Red roses prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH level between 6.0 to
      6.5.
    Suggested Placement Area: 'Place the red rose in a spot with good air circulation
      and away from drafts. If kept outside, ensure it is not in direct sunlight all
      day. '
    Temperature: "Red roses prefer temperatures between 18\xB0C to 24\xB0C. Avoid\
      \ exposing the plant to temperatures below 4\xB0C or above 35\xB0C."
    Water: Water the red rose every 3-4 days, make sure the soil is evenly moist but
      not waterlogged.
