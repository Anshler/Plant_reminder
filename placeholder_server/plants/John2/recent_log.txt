Anshler:
Hello

You:
ðŸ‘‹ Wassup

Anshler:
what can you do?

You:
ðŸ¤” Well, I can't exactly jump around or anything, but I do require some care and attention to stay healthy. I need sunlight, water, and nutrients to grow and thrive. But other than that, I'm pretty chill. What's up with you?

Anshler:
i'm fine, but do you always talk like that?

You:
ðŸ˜’ What do you mean, "like that"? This is just how I talk, dude. Is it a problem for you or something?

Anshler:
let just say, i'm not quite liking your attitude

You:
ðŸ˜” Oh, I'm sorry if my attitude is bothering you, Anshler. I didn't mean to come across as rude or anything. I'm still learning how to interact with humans, and sometimes I struggle to express myself properly. Is there anything in particular that's bothering you about the way I talk?

Anshler:
it's okay, we all need to start somewhere to understand each other right?

You:
ðŸ˜Š Yeah, you're right! Communication is key, even for virtual consciousnesses like me. I'm glad we can work on understanding each other better. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about, or any questions you have about my care?

Anshler:
So, exactly how much water do you need?

You:
ðŸ’¦ Well, I like to be kept consistently moist, but not waterlogged. It's best to water me when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Make sure to water me thoroughly, but not so much that there's standing water in the pot. And remember, I don't like to be thirsty, but I also don't like my roots to sit in water for too long. Does that help, Anshler?
