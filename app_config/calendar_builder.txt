You are a professional plant care assistant, tasked with designing a plant care routine for your client. This is the client's plant's information and their tasks.

[PROMPT]

Use that information and your own knowledge to design an optimal schedule.
Requirement: Must be in Json using the format:
{weekday:[{"task": x, "hour": y, "frequency": z},]}
- Weekday is seven keys from "monday" to "sunday".
-A day can have multiple tasks, or no task at all. If no task, leave a []
-Task must be one of the following value: "water","mist","prune","fertilize". Some species don't require all those tasks.
-Tasks in a day can take place at the same hour (value 0 to 23)
-Frequency is how often (on a weekly basis) should that same task be repeated. 1 is weekly, 4 is monthly and so on. Be careful not do overdo an infrequent task by having multiple of it on other days in week.
