  Humidity: Fiddle leaf figs are tolerant of lower humidity levels than some other
    tropical plants, but they still prefer a moderately humid environment. It is recommended
    to place a humidifier nearby, especially during the dry season.
  Light: Fiddle leaf figs prefer bright, indirect light but can adapt to medium light.
    They do not do well in low light or direct sunlight which can cause their leaves
    to burn.
  Others: Fiddle Leaf Fig leaves are sensitive to touch and can become damaged easily.
    It is important to prune the plant regularly to maintain its shape. Yellowing
    or dropped leaves can indicate under or over watering, insect infestation, or
    disease. If you have any concerns, it is recommended to consult with a local plant
    care specialist.
  Overview: Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) is a tropical plant native to western Africa.
    It is a popular houseplant with large, violin-shaped leaves that can grow up to
    18 inches long and thrive in warm environments.
  PH Level: Fiddle leaf figs prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil. The optimal pH
    range is between 6.0-7.0.
  Suggested Placement Area: Place Fiddle Leaf Fig in a large container in a well-draining
    potting mix and position it in a spot that gets bright, indirect light or partial
    shade. It is recommended to turn the plant every few months so that all leaves
    receive equal sunlight.
  Temperature: "Fiddle leaf figs prefer a temperature range between 60-85 degrees\
    \ Fahrenheit (15-29 degrees Celsius). They can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures\
    \ but should not be exposed to cold drafts or temperatures below 50\xB0F (10\xB0\
    C)."
  Water: Water the Fiddle Leaf Fig thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry. Avoid
    watering too much or too little. It is best to let the soil dry out slightly between
    watering. Water less in winter months and more in the summer
plant1:
  Humidity: Cactus used to dry environments and hence does not need high humidity.
  Light: Cactus prefers bright and direct sunlight. At least 6 hours a day.
  Others: During the summer months, it is advisable to move the cactus outdoors in
    a sunny location. Cactus is susceptible to root rot and hence it is critical to
    ensure the pot has adequate drainage holes and soil is well-draining. Avoid over-fertilizing
    the cactus.
  Overview: Cactus is a low maintenance plant that can adapt to harsh conditions.
  PH Level: Cactus prefers slightly acidic soil, with PH levels of 5.5-7.
  Suggested Placement Area: Ideal placement would be on a windowsill facing the sun.
    Ensure the windowsill has adequate drainage for excess water and possible condensation.
  Temperature: Cactus thrives well in average room temperatures, from 20-27 degrees
    Celsius. During winter, temperatures should not drop below 10 degrees Celsius.
  Water: Watering once a month is enough. Do not over-water the cactus. Ensure the
    soil completely dries out before watering. During winter when the cactus is dormant,
    water even less often, about once every 6 to 8 weeks.
plant2:
  Humidity: Roses prefer moderate to high humidity levels.
  Light: Roses require full sun exposure to bloom properly, at least 6 hours of direct
    sunlight daily.
  Others: Roses benefit from regular fertilization and pruning to promote healthy
    growth and flowering. Look out for common pests such as aphids and spider mites.
  Overview: Roses are perennial flowering plants native to Asia and are popular for
    their showy, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors.
  PH Level: Roses prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0-6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: Roses do well in outdoor gardens or in large pots. They
    need plenty of space to grow and airflow around the plant to avoid diseases.
  Temperature: "Roses tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but prefer cooler temperatures\
    \ between 60-75\xB0F."
  Water: Roses require deep watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between watering.
    During hot and dry periods, increase watering frequency to avoid the soil drying
    out completely. Avoid wetting the leaves as it can cause diseases.
