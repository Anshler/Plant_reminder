plant0:
  Humidity: Sunflowers can tolerate a wide range of humidity levels, but they prefer
    lower humidity.
  Light: Sunflowers require full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight
    per day.
  Others: Sunflowers are heavy feeders and benefit from regular fertilization throughout
    the growing season. They are also prone to insect pests such as aphids, so it's
    important to monitor them regularly and treat as needed.
  Overview: Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) are annual plants native to North America.
    They are known for their large, bright yellow flowers that follow the movement
    of the sun throughout the day.
  PH Level: Sunflowers prefer a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH between 6.0-7.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: Sunflowers are best suited for outdoor planting in garden
    beds or large containers. They can also be grown indoors in pots, but may require
    additional artificial light to supplement natural daylight.
  Temperature: "Sunflowers prefer warm temperatures between 70-80\xB0F (21-27\xB0\
    C). They can tolerate cooler temperatures, but frost can damage them."
  Water: Sunflowers should be watered deeply once a week. The soil should be moist
    but not waterlogged. Sunflowers can tolerate periods of drought.
plant1:
  Humidity: Fiddle leaf figs are tolerant of lower humidity levels than some other
    tropical plants, but they still prefer a moderately humid environment. It is recommended
    to place a humidifier nearby, especially during the dry season.
  Light: Fiddle leaf figs prefer bright, indirect light but can adapt to medium light.
    They do not do well in low light or direct sunlight which can cause their leaves
    to burn.
  Others: Fiddle Leaf Fig leaves are sensitive to touch and can become damaged easily.
    It is important to prune the plant regularly to maintain its shape. Yellowing
    or dropped leaves can indicate under or over watering, insect infestation, or
    disease. If you have any concerns, it is recommended to consult with a local plant
    care specialist.
  Overview: Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) is a tropical plant native to western Africa.
    It is a popular houseplant with large, violin-shaped leaves that can grow up to
    18 inches long and thrive in warm environments.
  PH Level: Fiddle leaf figs prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil. The optimal pH
    range is between 6.0-7.0.
  Suggested Placement Area: Place Fiddle Leaf Fig in a large container in a well-draining
    potting mix and position it in a spot that gets bright, indirect light or partial
    shade. It is recommended to turn the plant every few months so that all leaves
    receive equal sunlight.
  Temperature: "Fiddle leaf figs prefer a temperature range between 60-85 degrees\
    \ Fahrenheit (15-29 degrees Celsius). They can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures\
    \ but should not be exposed to cold drafts or temperatures below 50\xB0F (10\xB0\
    C)."
  Water: Water the Fiddle Leaf Fig thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry. Avoid
    watering too much or too little. It is best to let the soil dry out slightly between
    watering. Water less in winter months and more in the summer
plant2:
  Humidity: Winter ferns thrive in high humidity environments of at least 50%. In
    drier conditions, they may develop brown tips on their fronds. Mist the plant
    frequently or place it in a humid area, such as a bathroom.
  Light: Winter ferns prefer bright, indirect light. They can tolerate some direct
    sunlight, but too much can scorch their delicate fronds. In low light conditions,
    their fronds may become less colorful.
  Others: '- Fertilize your winter ferns every 2-4 weeks during the growing season
    with a general-purpose houseplant fertilizer.

    - Trim off any dead or yellowing fronds to encourage new growth.

    - Check your winter ferns regularly for pests such as spider mites and mealybugs.'
  Overview: "Winter ferns, also known as \u201CDryopteris erythrosora,\u201D are a\
    \ beautiful type of fern that originated in Asia. They are characterized by their\
    \ copper-colored fronds that turn green as they mature. They are hardy plants\
    \ that are easy to care for."
  PH Level: Winter ferns prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.5-6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: Winter ferns are ideal for indoor spaces such as living
    rooms, bedrooms, or offices. They can also be placed outdoors in shady areas.
  Temperature: Winter ferns prefer temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit (15-24
    degrees Celsius). They can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures, but avoid placing
    them near drafts or vents.
  Water: Water your winter ferns when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch.
    Water thoroughly but make sure not to let the soil become soggy. Withhold watering
    during the winter when the plant is dormant.
plant3:
  Humidity: Cactus used to dry environments and hence does not need high humidity.
  Light: Cactus prefers bright and direct sunlight. At least 6 hours a day.
  Others: During the summer months, it is advisable to move the cactus outdoors in
    a sunny location. Cactus is susceptible to root rot and hence it is critical to
    ensure the pot has adequate drainage holes and soil is well-draining. Avoid over-fertilizing
    the cactus.
  Overview: Cactus is a low maintenance plant that can adapt to harsh conditions.
  PH Level: Cactus prefers slightly acidic soil, with PH levels of 5.5-7.
  Suggested Placement Area: Ideal placement would be on a windowsill facing the sun.
    Ensure the windowsill has adequate drainage for excess water and possible condensation.
  Temperature: Cactus thrives well in average room temperatures, from 20-27 degrees
    Celsius. During winter, temperatures should not drop below 10 degrees Celsius.
  Water: Watering once a month is enough. Do not over-water the cactus. Ensure the
    soil completely dries out before watering. During winter when the cactus is dormant,
    water even less often, about once every 6 to 8 weeks.
plant4:
  Humidity: Humidity is not a major concern for tulips. They can tolerate a range
    of humidity levels.
  Light: Tulips prefer bright, indirect light. Keep them near a window that receives
    morning sunlight, but avoid direct afternoon sunlight as it can be too strong.
  Others: Tulips can be prone to pest infestations, such as aphids or spider mites.
    Keep an eye out for any signs of infestation and treat promptly if necessary.
    In Vietnam, it is important to keep the tulip moist without overwatering, as long
    dry spells and high temperatures can stress the plant.
  Overview: Tulip is a bulbous perennial with showy flowers. It blooms in spring and
    can be grown indoors or outdoors.
  PH Level: Tulips grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH between
    6.0-7.0.
  Suggested Placement Area: Place the tulip in a well-draining potting mix in a container
    with drainage holes. Keep the plant indoors near a bright window or outdoors in
    a cool, shaded area.
  Temperature: "Tulips prefer cooler temperatures around 60-65\xB0F (15-18\xB0C).\
    \ Avoid exposing them to temperatures above 70\xB0F (21\xB0C)."
  Water: Water the tulip once per week, or when the soil has dried out. Do not overwater
    as this can cause the bulb to rot.
plant5:
  Humidity: Roses prefer moderate to high humidity levels.
  Light: Roses require full sun exposure to bloom properly, at least 6 hours of direct
    sunlight daily.
  Others: Roses benefit from regular fertilization and pruning to promote healthy
    growth and flowering. Look out for common pests such as aphids and spider mites.
  Overview: Roses are perennial flowering plants native to Asia and are popular for
    their showy, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors.
  PH Level: Roses prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0-6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: Roses do well in outdoor gardens or in large pots. They
    need plenty of space to grow and airflow around the plant to avoid diseases.
  Temperature: "Roses tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but prefer cooler temperatures\
    \ between 60-75\xB0F."
  Water: Roses require deep watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between watering.
    During hot and dry periods, increase watering frequency to avoid the soil drying
    out completely. Avoid wetting the leaves as it can cause diseases.
