  Overview: ''
  Water: Water the red rose every 3-4 days, make sure the soil is evenly moist but
    not waterlogged.
  Light: Red roses prefer full sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. Place the plant
    near a south or west-facing window.
  Humidity: Red roses prefer a moderate to high humidity level. Mist the leaves regularly,
    especially during dry seasons.
  Temperature: "Red roses prefer temperatures between 18\xB0C to 24\xB0C. Avoid exposing\
    \ the plant to temperatures below 4\xB0C or above 35\xB0C."
  PH Level: Red roses prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH level between 6.0 to 6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: 'Place the red rose in a spot with good air circulation
    and away from drafts. If kept outside, ensure it is not in direct sunlight all
    day. '
  Others: Prune your rose regularly to remove dead or diseased parts and promote healthy
    growth. Provide support for the plant as it grows, as the branches can become
    heavy with flowers. Use a balanced fertilizer every two weeks during the growing
    season.

  Overview: Tulips are a spring-blooming perennial with showy flowers. They are native
    to Central Asia and are widely grown as an ornamental plant.
  Water: Water the tulip once a week. Keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged,
    as the bulbs can rot. Water more often during periods of drought or high temperatures.
  Light: Tulips prefer full sun to partial shade. They need at least six hours of
    sunlight per day to bloom properly.
  Humidity: Tulips prefer low humidity. High humidity can lead to fungal diseases.
  Temperature: "Tulips prefer cool temperatures between 60-68\xB0F (16-20\xB0C). Hot\
    \ and humid climates can be challenging for tulips."
  PH Level: Tulips prefer a slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0-6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: Tulips can be planted in garden beds or containers. They
    are perfect for borders and rock gardens.
  Others: After blooming, allow the foliage to die back naturally before removing
    it. This allows the plant to store energy for next year's bloom. Tulips are typically
    planted in the fall for spring bloom. In warmer climates, they may need to be
    refrigerated for a period of time before planting to simulate winter conditions.

  Overview: Roses are flowering deciduous perennial plants that come in a variety
    of species, sizes, and colors. They require adequate light exposure, a regular
    watering schedule, and precise care to achieve a healthy and long-lasting appearance
    throughout their life cycle.
  Water: Roses need deep watering once or twice a week, depending on the climate and
    temperature. If in a hot and dry location, they may require more frequent waterings.
    Ensure that the soil is consistently moist but not waterlogged as this can lead
    to root rot.
  Light: Roses require at least 6 hours of direct sunlight every day. If grown indoors,
    place the plant in a location where it can receive ample amounts of natural light
    or supplement with artificial grow lights.
  Humidity: Roses prefer a moderate to high humidity level, but they can tolerate
    low humidity environments. To increase humidity levels, place a tray of water
    near the plant or use a humidifier.
  Temperature: "Roses grow best in temperatures between 60\xB0F to 75\xB0F (15\xB0\
    C to 24\xB0C) during the day and between 40\xB0F to 60\xB0F (4\xB0C to 15\xB0\
    C) at night. They cannot tolerate frost or extreme heat."
  PH Level: The ideal pH for roses is between 6.0 to 6.5. Test the soil regularly
    to maintain the correct pH levels for optimal growth.
  Suggested Placement Area: Roses can be grown both indoors and outdoors. They require
    ample space to accommodate their root systems and thrive in areas with good drainage.
  Others: Prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and remove any dead or damaged
    leaves or branches. Fertilize every 2-3 months during the growing season with
    a formula specifically designed for roses.
