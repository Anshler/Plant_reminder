  Overview: Roses are beautiful flowering plants known for their fragrant and vibrant
    flowers. They come in various colors and can add beauty to any garden or indoor
    space.
  Water: Roses generally require regular watering, especially during the growing season.
    It's important to keep the soil evenly moist, but not waterlogged. Water deeply
    and thoroughly, ensuring that the water reaches the roots. Avoid overhead watering
    as it can lead to the development of fungal diseases.
  Light: Roses thrive in full sun, ideally receiving at least 6-8 hours of direct
    sunlight each day. They require bright and direct light for proper growth and
    flower production.
  Humidity: Roses can tolerate a wide range of humidity levels but generally prefer
    average to slightly higher humidity. Normal room humidity is usually sufficient,
    but if the air is particularly dry, you can increase humidity around the plant
    by using a humidifier or placing a tray of water nearby.
  Temperature: "Most roses prefer moderate temperatures between 60-75\xB0F (15-24\xB0\
    C) during the day and slightly cooler temperatures around 50-60\xB0F (10-15\xB0\
    C) at night. However, different rose varieties have different temperature requirements,\
    \ so it's always best to choose varieties that are suitable for your climate."
  PH Level: Roses prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range between 6.0
    and 7.0. You can check the soil pH using a pH testing kit available at garden
    centers. If the soil is too acidic, you can add organic matter or lime to adjust
    the pH level.
  Suggested Placement Area: Roses are typically grown outdoors in sunny areas, either
    in garden beds or containers. They require ample space for their roots to spread
    and good air circulation. When growing roses indoors, choose a location near a
    bright window where they can receive adequate sunlight.
  Others: Roses benefit from regular feeding with a balanced rose fertilizer during
    the growing season. Pruning is also essential to maintain their shape and promote
    new growth. Regularly monitor for common pests and diseases like aphids, black
    spot, and powdery mildew, and take appropriate measures to protect the plant.
