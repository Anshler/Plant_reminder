  Humidity: Ferns require relatively high humidity levels, ideally between 40-60%.
    If the air in your home is particularly dry, consider using a humidifier or placing
    a tray of water near your plant to increase moisture levels. Misting your fern
    regularly can also help to boost humidity levels.
  Light: Ferns prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch their delicate
    leaves, so be sure to place your fern in a location that receives plenty of filtered
    light throughout the day.
  Others: Fertilize your fern once a month during the growing season (spring and summer)
    with a balanced houseplant fertilizer. Trim off any dead or damaged fronds as
    needed to promote new growth and maintain the plant's appearance.
  Overview: Ferns are leafy, green plants with delicate, frilly fronds. They require
    relatively high humidity levels and moderate temperatures to thrive.
  PH Level: Ferns prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 to 7.0.
  Suggested Placement Area: Ferns are versatile and can thrive in a variety of locations,
    including bathrooms, bedrooms or living rooms. Consider placing them near a window
    with filtered light and ensuring their surrounding environment has enough moisture
    and humidity.
  Temperature: "Ferns prefer moderate temperatures between 60-75\xB0F (15-24\xB0C).\
    \ Avoid exposing your fern to sudden temperature changes, such as drafts or air\
    \ conditioning."
  Water: Water your fern regularly, ensuring that the soil never dries out completely.
    Be careful not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot. In general, watering
    once a week should be sufficient, but depending on the humidity level in your
    home and the size of your plant, you may need to water more or less often.

  Humidity: Red roses prefer a moderate to high humidity level. Mist the leaves regularly,
    especially during dry seasons.
  Light: Red roses prefer full sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. Place the plant
    near a south or west-facing window.
  Others: Prune your rose regularly to remove dead or diseased parts and promote healthy
    growth. Provide support for the plant as it grows, as the branches can become
    heavy with flowers. Use a balanced fertilizer every two weeks during the growing
    season.
  Overview: ''
  PH Level: Red roses prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH level between 6.0 to 6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: 'Place the red rose in a spot with good air circulation
    and away from drafts. If kept outside, ensure it is not in direct sunlight all
    day. '
  Temperature: "Red roses prefer temperatures between 18\xB0C to 24\xB0C. Avoid exposing\
    \ the plant to temperatures below 4\xB0C or above 35\xB0C."
  Water: Water the red rose every 3-4 days, make sure the soil is evenly moist but
    not waterlogged.
