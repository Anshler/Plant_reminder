  Humidity: Roses prefer moderate humidity levels but can tolerate dry air. Using
    a humidifier or placing a tray of water near the plant can help increase humidity
    levels in dry indoor environments.
  Light: Roses require full sun to thrive, meaning at least 6 hours of direct sunlight
    each day. In hotter climates, it may be necessary to provide partial shade during
    the hottest part of the day to prevent the plants from overheating.
  Others: Prune roses regularly to promote healthy growth and increase blooming. Fertilize
    with a slow-release fertilizer in the spring and again in mid-summer. Watch out
    for common pests such as aphids and spider mites, and treat with insecticidal
    soap if necessary.
  Overview: Roses are popular ornamental plants, typically grown for their beautiful
    flowers. They come in many different colors and varieties, from miniature plants
    that stay under 2 feet tall to climbing roses that can reach up to 20 feet.
  PH Level: Roses grow best in slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0-6.5. It's
    a good idea to test the pH levels of the soil occasionally and adjust if needed.
  Suggested Placement Area: Roses are commonly grown in outdoor gardens, but they
    can also be grown indoors if given proper care and attention. When growing indoors,
    choose a bright, sunny window or use artificial grow lights.
  Temperature: "Roses prefer moderate temperatures, ideally between 60-75\xB0F (15-23\xB0\
    C). Avoid exposing them to extreme heat or cold."
  Water: Water roses deeply once a week, providing enough water to soak the roots
    and penetrate the soil. Avoid frequent shallow watering, which can lead to weak
    and shallow roots. The amount of water required may vary depending on the climate
    and time of year.

  Humidity: Ferns require relatively high humidity levels, ideally between 40-60%.
    If the air in your home is particularly dry, consider using a humidifier or placing
    a tray of water near your plant to increase moisture levels. Misting your fern
    regularly can also help to boost humidity levels.
  Light: Ferns prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch their delicate
    leaves, so be sure to place your fern in a location that receives plenty of filtered
    light throughout the day.
  Others: Fertilize your fern once a month during the growing season (spring and summer)
    with a balanced houseplant fertilizer. Trim off any dead or damaged fronds as
    needed to promote new growth and maintain the plant's appearance.
  Overview: Ferns are leafy, green plants with delicate, frilly fronds. They require
    relatively high humidity levels and moderate temperatures to thrive.
  PH Level: Ferns prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 to 7.0.
  Suggested Placement Area: Ferns are versatile and can thrive in a variety of locations,
    including bathrooms, bedrooms or living rooms. Consider placing them near a window
    with filtered light and ensuring their surrounding environment has enough moisture
    and humidity.
  Temperature: "Ferns prefer moderate temperatures between 60-75\xB0F (15-24\xB0C).\
    \ Avoid exposing your fern to sudden temperature changes, such as drafts or air\
    \ conditioning."
  Water: Water your fern regularly, ensuring that the soil never dries out completely.
    Be careful not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot. In general, watering
    once a week should be sufficient, but depending on the humidity level in your
    home and the size of your plant, you may need to water more or less often.
