  Humidity: Red roses prefer a moderate to high humidity level. Mist the leaves regularly,
    especially during dry seasons.
  Light: Red roses prefer full sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. Place the plant
    near a south or west-facing window.
  Others: Prune your rose regularly to remove dead or diseased parts and promote healthy
    growth. Provide support for the plant as it grows, as the branches can become
    heavy with flowers. Use a balanced fertilizer every two weeks during the growing
    season.
  Overview: ''
  PH Level: Red roses prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH level between 6.0 to 6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: 'Place the red rose in a spot with good air circulation
    and away from drafts. If kept outside, ensure it is not in direct sunlight all
    day. '
  Temperature: "Red roses prefer temperatures between 18\xB0C to 24\xB0C. Avoid exposing\
    \ the plant to temperatures below 4\xB0C or above 35\xB0C."
  Water: Water the red rose every 3-4 days, make sure the soil is evenly moist but
    not waterlogged.

  Humidity: Ferns love humidity! They do better in areas where there is a higher humidity
    level. Place a tray with water next to your fern or use a humifier, helping increase
    the humidity surrounding your plant.
  Light: Ferns prefer indirect or filtered light. Too much direct light will scorch
    the leaves, while too little light will cause the leaves to turn yellow or brown.
    Place your ferns near north or east-facing windows where they can receive bright
    but indirect light.
  Others: Ferns do not require pruning but it is recommended to remove any yellow
    or dead leaves to help the plant grow and flourish. Fertilize your fern regularly
    to supplement the nutritional need. Apply 1/4-strength balanced liquid fertilizer
    every month during spring and summer.
  Overview: "Ferns are non-flowering plants that date all the way back to the prehistoric\
    \ era. They\u2019re often grown for their unique and delicate foliage."
  PH Level: Ferns prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH level between 6 and 7.
  Suggested Placement Area: Ferns are often kept in bathrooms, kitchens, hallways,
    and other areas with higher humidity levels.
  Temperature: "Ferns prefer temperatures between 18-24\xB0C (65-75\xB0F). Keep plants\
    \ away from heating and cooling vents and windows to avoid rapid temperature changes."
  Water: Ferns require constantly moist soil but not waterlogged. Water the fern when
    the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, usually once every week, or when
    you notice the leaves starting to droop. During the winter season, you can water
    less.

  Humidity: Sunflowers are not particularly sensitive to humidity, but they do need
    a moderate amount of moisture in the air to thrive. The ideal humidity level for
    sunflowers is around 50-60%, but they can tolerate lower levels for short periods.
  Light: Sunflowers need direct sunlight. They require full sun, which means at least
    6 hours of direct sunlight per day. If your sunflowers are grown indoors, place
    them in a south-facing window or under grow lights to ensure they receive enough
    light.
  Others: "To promote bushier growth and more blooms, pinch off the top of the main\
    \ stem when the plant is about 18 inches (45 cm) tall. This will encourage the\
    \ plant to produce more lateral branches and result in more flowers. Deadhead\
    \ regularly \u2013 it will encourage more blooms and also help prevent mold growth\
    \ on the flowers."
  Overview: Sunflowers are annual plants that are known for their large, yellow flower
    heads.
  PH Level: Sunflowers grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range
    of 6.0-7.5. If the soil is too acidic, add lime to lower the acidity. If it is
    too alkaline, add sulfur or peat moss to raise the acidity.
  Suggested Placement Area: Sunflowers are typically grown outdoors in gardens or
    fields, but they can also be grown in large pots or containers. As mentioned earlier,
    sunflowers require full sun, so make sure to choose a location that gets plenty
    of direct sunlight.
  Temperature: "Sunflowers prefer warm temperatures between 70-78\xB0F (21-25\xB0\
    C). They do not tolerate frost or freezing temperatures. If growing sunflowers\
    \ indoors, ensure that the room they are in is kept at a temperature within this\
    \ range."
  Water: "Water the sunflower deeply and regularly. The soil should be consistently\
    \ moist, but not waterlogged. For sunflowers grown in pots, check the soil moisture\
    \ daily. If the top inch of soil is dry, it\u2019s time to water. During hot,\
    \ dry weather, sunflowers may require watering once a day. In cooler weather,\
    \ watering every 2-3 days may be sufficient."

  Humidity: Roses prefer moderate to high humidity, around 50-60%. In dry climates,
    regular misting or use of a humidifier can help.
  Light: Roses require at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. If they receive
    less than this, they may not bloom well.
  Others: Prune away any dead or damaged branches as needed and apply a slow-release
    fertilizer in spring and mid-summer to encourage healthy growth and blooming.
  Overview: Roses are perennial plants with beautiful, fragrant flowers. They grow
    well in most climates, but require special care in hot humid regions like subsahara
    Africa due to risk of fungal diseases.
  PH Level: Roses prefer a soil pH between 5.5-7.0. Test the soil regularly and adjust
    as needed with the addition of lime to raise pH or sulfur to lower pH.
  Suggested Placement Area: Roses should be planted in a sunny area with well-draining
    soil. They can be grown in a garden bed or in containers on a patio or balcony.
  Temperature: "Roses thrive in temperatures between 18-27\xB0C (65-80\xB0F). They\
    \ can tolerate temperatures as low as 0\xB0C (32\xB0F) and as high as 40\xB0C\
    \ (104\xB0F), but extreme temperatures can damage the plant."
  Water: Water thoroughly and deeply once a week, keeping the soil consistently moist
    but not waterlogged. Water less frequently in the rainy season or if the soil
    feels damp.
