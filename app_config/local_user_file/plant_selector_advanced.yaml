  Overview: ''
  Water: Water the red rose every 3-4 days, make sure the soil is evenly moist but
    not waterlogged.
  Light: Red roses prefer full sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. Place the plant
    near a south or west-facing window.
  Humidity: Red roses prefer a moderate to high humidity level. Mist the leaves regularly,
    especially during dry seasons.
  Temperature: "Red roses prefer temperatures between 18\xB0C to 24\xB0C. Avoid exposing\
    \ the plant to temperatures below 4\xB0C or above 35\xB0C."
  PH Level: Red roses prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH level between 6.0 to 6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: 'Place the red rose in a spot with good air circulation
    and away from drafts. If kept outside, ensure it is not in direct sunlight all
    day. '
  Others: Prune your rose regularly to remove dead or diseased parts and promote healthy
    growth. Provide support for the plant as it grows, as the branches can become
    heavy with flowers. Use a balanced fertilizer every two weeks during the growing
    season.

  Overview: Tulips are a spring-blooming perennial with showy flowers. They are native
    to Central Asia and are widely grown as an ornamental plant.
  Water: Water the tulip once a week. Keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged,
    as the bulbs can rot. Water more often during periods of drought or high temperatures.
  Light: Tulips prefer full sun to partial shade. They need at least six hours of
    sunlight per day to bloom properly.
  Humidity: Tulips prefer low humidity. High humidity can lead to fungal diseases.
  Temperature: "Tulips prefer cool temperatures between 60-68\xB0F (16-20\xB0C). Hot\
    \ and humid climates can be challenging for tulips."
  PH Level: Tulips prefer a slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0-6.5.
  Suggested Placement Area: Tulips can be planted in garden beds or containers. They
    are perfect for borders and rock gardens.
  Others: After blooming, allow the foliage to die back naturally before removing
    it. This allows the plant to store energy for next year's bloom. Tulips are typically
    planted in the fall for spring bloom. In warmer climates, they may need to be
    refrigerated for a period of time before planting to simulate winter conditions.

  Overview: Roses are one of the most popular garden plants due to their beauty and
    fragrance. They are deciduous plants that can bloom in a range of colors.
  Water: Roses need moderate watering, but they don't like standing water. Water them
    when the top inch of soil is dry. The frequency of watering depends on the humidity
    and temperature. In general, water roses once or twice a week.
  Light: Roses need at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. They prefer full
    sun exposure for optimal growth and blooming.
  Humidity: Roses prefer a moderate level of humidity, ideally around 40-60%. They
    can tolerate lower humidity, but high humidity can promote fungal diseases.
  Temperature: "Roses prefer temperatures between 60-75\xB0F (15-24\xB0C) during the\
    \ day and around 50-60\xB0F (10-15\xB0C) at night. In warmer climates, they can\
    \ tolerate higher temperatures, but they may suffer in extreme heat."
  PH Level: Roses prefer soil with a pH level between 6.0-6.5. If your soil is too
    alkaline, add sulfur to lower the pH level. If it is too acidic, add lime to raise
    the pH level.
  Suggested Placement Area: Roses can be planted in the ground or in containers. They
    need well-draining soil and air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. Roses
    can be planted in any sunny area in your garden.
  Others: Roses benefit from occasional fertilization, pruning, and deadheading. You
    can use a fertilizer with a balanced NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 5-5-5 in early spring
    and mid-summer. Prune roses in late winter or early spring to remove dead or diseased
    wood. Deadheading spent blooms can promote reblooming.
